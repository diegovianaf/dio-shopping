This project has two pages:
- A home page with a list of products that you can add to the shopping cart,  add or remove the items. 
- A contact page you can send a message, since you are running the [Server Side API](https://github.com/diegovianaf/dio-shopping-api) of this project.


In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
